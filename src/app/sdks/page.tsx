      <p>
        We offer official SDKs (Software Development Kits) for various
        programming languages to help you quickly integrate the Protocol API
        into your applications. These SDKs handle authentication, make API
        requests, and provide convenient wrappers to interact with the Protocol
        platform.
      </p>
      <h2 id="official-sdks">Official SDKs</h2>
      <p>
        Our official SDKs are developed and maintained by the Protocol team. We
        strive to keep them up-to-date and aligned with the latest API changes,
        making them a reliable choice for integrating the Protocol API into your
        projects.

      <h3>1. JavaScript SDK</h3>
      <p>
        The JavaScript SDK allows you to interact with the Protocol API using
        JavaScript or TypeScript. It can be used in both browser-based and
        server-side applications. To get started, you need to have Node.js
        installed on your development machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find the JavaScript SDK on GitHub:{" "}

      </p>
      <h3>2. Python SDK</h3>
      <p>
        The Python SDK enables you to interact with the Protocol API using
        Python. It provides a user-friendly interface for making API requests
        and handling responses. The Python SDK is compatible with both Python 2
        and 3.

      <h2 id="community-sdks">Community SDKs</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to our official SDKs, the Protocol community has developed
        various SDKs for different programming languages and frameworks. While
        these SDKs are not maintained by the Protocol team, they can be valuable
        resources for developers who prefer specific languages or have
        specialized needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can explore community SDKs on GitHub and other community-driven
        platforms.
      </p>
      <h2 id="getting-started-with-sdks">Getting Started with SDKs</h2>
      <p>
        Each SDK comes with its own documentation and examples to help you get
        started. To use an SDK, follow the installation instructions provided in
        the respective repository. You'll need your API credentials (client ID
        and secret) to authenticate your requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the SDKs, feel
        free to ask for help in our developer community forums or open an issue
        on the SDK's GitHub repository.
